# Average of Divider

This repo contains a program which takes average of numbers that divided by 3 and 4.
This is a homework at [Patika.dev](https://app.patika.dev/egitimler/java-ile-backend-web-development-patikasi/java101/pratik-cift-sayi-toplam)

## How does it work?
just give a number which is greater than zero. It will find the numbers which can be divided to 3 and 4 and sum them up. 
Then it takes average of that numbers. Notice that it will count zero too as a divided number.
